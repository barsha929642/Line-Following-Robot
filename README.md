Line Following Robot with Arduino Uno


Welcome to the Line Following Robot project repository! This project demonstrates the creation of a simple yet effective line-following robot using an Arduino Uno. The robot is designed to autonomously follow a predefined path marked by a contrasting coloured line on a surface.

Overview
The Line Following Robot utilizes infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and make decisions about its movement. The Arduino Uno processes the sensor data and controls the motors to keep the robot following the line.

Components
Arduino Uno
Infrared (IR) sensors (pair)
Motor driver module
Motors (with wheels)
Chassis
Wheels
Power supply (battery)
Wiring
Ensure proper wiring of the components. Connect the IR sensors, motor driver, and motors according to the circuit diagram provided in the docs folder.

How to Use
Upload the Arduino code (line_following_robot.ino) to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
Power up the robot with a suitable battery.
Place the robot on a surface with a contrasting line.
Watch as the robot autonomously follows the line!
Troubleshooting
If the robot deviates from the line, check and adjust the sensor calibration.
Ensure that the motors are functioning correctly and that the wheels have proper traction.
